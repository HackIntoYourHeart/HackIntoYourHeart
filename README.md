## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello everyone, you can call me Vampire. Haha, because I look younger than my age.
I have 3 years of experience in programming, working on various projects.
The primary languages I use are JavaScript/TypeScript and Java. I also work frequently with AWS.

Linus Torvalds is someone I always look up to for both his working style and his unique personality, so I use his image as my avatar.
All my public repositories are free for you to use.
Additionally, if you'd like to reach out for work inquiries, please contact me using the information below.
